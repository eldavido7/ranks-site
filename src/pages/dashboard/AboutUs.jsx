                    Adsterra started with a friendship and grew to be a successful business that still retains its core values: putting great emphasis on
                    teamwork, transparency, commitment, consistency, quality, and always being ready to support and help both clients and colleagues.

                <p className="ml-8">
                    Founded in 2013 by professional affiliate marketers and webmasters with over 20 years of experience, Adsterra has developed into a
                    trusted name in the industry. What started as a shared vision has now blossomed into a platform that blends technology and human
                    intelligence to deliver excellence.

                    &quot;We were friends at school and university, brought together by our shared interest in technology and marketing, as well as the desire to
                    find the best way to attain self-realization and success. While striving to grow financially, we didn’t want to get tangled up in the
                    complex corporate culture.&quot;

                    Adsterra’s founders wanted to create something new, both for themselves and for the market. The result is a company with a professional
                    IT department, experienced account managers, and a team of dedicated employees who strive to provide outstanding support and solutions
                    for advertisers and publishers.
